# HTTP Request

**What does an HTTP request even look like?**

An HTTP request is created by a client to access a resource on the server.
An HTTP request will contain the following elements:
 1. A request line
 2. Headers *(Defines how the server might process the request, key/value pairs separated by a colon)*
 3. Body *(The content of the data)*

# HTTP Response

**What does an HTTP response even look like?**

An HTTP response is created by a server to respond to a client's request.
An HTTP response will contain the following elements:
 1. A status line
 2. Headers
 3. Message body

Status Codes:
- 100 - 199: Informational
- 200 - 299: Successful
- 300 - 399: Redirection
- 400 - 499: Client Error
- 500 - 599: Server Error

Common MIME types for the Content-Type header of a response:
- text/html	HTML document
- text/plain	plain text
- image/png	PNG Image
- application/json	JSON - data format similar to JavaScript object

# Pop Quiz

1. **In the HTTP request line, what is the method, URI, and HTTP version?**
2. **What are examples of Headers?**
3. **What is the body?**
4. **What are 5 common HTTP Verbs (methods)?**
5. **Give an example of a request/response cycle?**

# Pop Quiz
**Answers**
1. > POST, /, HTTP/1.0
2. > Few Examples: Host: appacademy.io
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Host: appacademy.io
3. > username=azure&password=hunter2
4. > GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
5. > When a user submits a form on the browser, the browser makes a **request** to the server with the contents of the HTML form inside of the request body.
Then, the server processes the request and **responds** back to the user with a specified resource.

# Promises

> "The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value." ~ MDN

> Fetch is an example of utilizing the Promise object. Fetch is used to make HTTP requests on the browser.
It uses Promises to handle the asynchronous nature of HTTP requests and responses.
Fetch is used to formulate and send a request to a server and read the server response.

> **Example using fetch:**

`const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  });`

`const data = response.json();`
